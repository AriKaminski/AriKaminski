### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Ari Kaminski, welcome to my special repository!

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on becoming a python developer. I have several projects and am currently working on school work.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about PC building, PC gaming, and the Philadelphia Eagles.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: You can reach me at arkaminski93@gmail.com . I also stream every now and then on twitch. My twitch username is Vanski_Pog

- âš¡ Fun fact: I own a 12 year old pitbull rescue named Van. Here is a picture of him in my front yard.
